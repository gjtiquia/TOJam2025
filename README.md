Ingredients will keep spawning! Try to keep up with the soup orders while navigating an increasingly messy kitchen!

[WASD] to move

[Left mouse] or [F] to interact

Pick up ingredients and put them into the pot to make soup. Interact with the pot again to pick up the soup. Serve soup orders at the register at the top right.

Each ingredient adds flavours to the soup. Soup orders are listed on the right of the screen. Combine ingredients in the pot to match the flavours of the soup orders.

Fill as many orders as you can before time runs out!
